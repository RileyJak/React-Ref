# React Ref 
## About Me
#### I am Riley a recent grad from Columbia College Chicago (May '21) with a degree in Interaction design. I  am a UX designer and UX engineer and want to change the world one experince and one user at a time. I started this refrence doc while taking PROG455 at Columbia and realized how nice it would be to have an organized collection of all the basic React principals we went over in class for later projects or helping friends.  
## Goals
#### To create an easy to use refrence for basic React concepts in action
## Content Sourcing 
#### All content is from the PROG455 App Design @ Columbia College Chicago with Mike Hadley. 
## Note 
####  This is a living document it is updated with my course work weekly as well as adjustments as I learn more. Also I am a student and still learning so there may be errors, cause I'm human, and even the best devs of all time make mistakes. If you do catch an error feel free to reach out so I can trouble shoot
